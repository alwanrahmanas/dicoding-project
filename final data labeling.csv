Modern Vice City with Florida crazy shit ? YES . YES . YES. We need this shit NOWWWW😩 lol on a serious note I am more than willing to wait till 2025 for this, obviously didn’t show much from the story, but from what I can tell it seems to be trying to tell a bit more of a serious story !! Which idk about you guys was exactly what I was hoping for ! Dont get me wrong I want the classic GTA humor in there too, but I am legit not disappointed by 1 single thing I’ve seen in this trailer. I’ve already watched it 3 times and I’ll probably watch it 5 more times before the night is done 😂 holy shit. I know I keep saying that but like, holy shiiiiit. Also, it looked like Lucia was meeting up with a probation officer at the beginning of the trailer? That leak about her having a baby could possibly be true",Trailer & Hype,1.0

"I made a post weeks ago and a lot of my predictions were stunningly accurate!  Happy post thanksgiving everyone! Just wanted to put out some of my predictions for what we may see  when the trailer finally drops in a few weeks. Some of these we won’t know for certain until the game finally drops or a few more detailed trailers come out.  1. First, It’ll be a rough cut original trailer like GTA IV “things will be different” and V “why did I move here”? which shows vice city and some interesting new content to chew on until we get new info.  2. Since the leak, I’d be willing to bet that R* is going to change the protagonist’s names as it was shown in addition to the style of dress, maybe even a complete overhaul, but I’m still thinking a female character will be one of the additions because it would be something different versus all the male protagonists that we’ve seen over the years.   3. Vehicles include a number of new boats like bass boats, small outboard boats, air boats, and large fishing boats, planes, helicopters, motorbikes, cars like pickup trucks, dune buggies, and bicycles.  4. Animals to be seen in game are alligators, pythons, wild boars, bears, cougars, pelicans, sharks, gamefish like marlin, sailfish, and grouper, dogs, cats, etc.   5. Fresh and saltwater fishing will be one of the new activities in addition to graffiti tagging.  6. Perhaps a call back or two to GTA IV, V, and of course OG vice city.  7. I would be blown away if the physics returned to a GTA IV level, but am thinking it will remain at the V standard.  8. More definitive weather events like hurricanes, tornados affecting more rural areas of the map, in addition to seeing how the ocean tides effect various areas around the map.  9. Unconventional weapons like spearguns, blunt force trauma items like rocks, bricks, cinderblocks, and melee weapons like pepper spray, tasers, and bean bag shotguns. Riot shields make an appearance at the amount of riots or protests that will play a role in the game. Classic GTA weapons like a MG249 and colt python like from vice city make a return.  10. Vehicle damage will be similar to GTA IV.  11. I’m hoping that the story will be akin to GTA IV which revolves around the American dream and revenge whilst incorporating aspects of GTA V heists.  12. Aspects of 2020’s American and world culture like social justice, transgender or no gender people, Israel/Palestinian conflict politics, and a TikTok parody like life invader.   a reference to the COVID 19 pandemic in which people may wear masks in public or be fearful of germs. Because trump resides in Florida, perhaps there will be a presidential person who has a great amount of secret service presence near them but that’s probably a stretch.    Just some of my early thoughts regarding the upcoming release of the trailer and ultimately the game itself. As for a release date, I would think it’s coming in the year 2025 and no later.  Please contribute your thoughts, hopes, and wishes for the latest installment of the greatest open world crime game ever conceived.  Thank you kindly!",Plot and Character,0.0

"Looks sick. Hopefully the rural parts of the game are kinda like RDR2 and you can explore, hunt, fish, etc and do backcountry type stuff in a detailed environment, and not an after thought. Hoping more buildings and homes are enterable in some way. Cyberpunk felt like it missed a lot because the vast majority of the city was inaccessible. I imagine Rockstar has the technology to make decent-enough indoor environments at scale, and then they can slowly add more detailed interiors as time passes.",Gameplay,1.0

All I gotta say is.......   **DAAAAAAYUUUUM LUCIA!**  That hourglass shape they gave her haha.  😳  I would say they have topped RDR2 graphics and they will have around 2 more years to polish it further.  You all have to remember it is much more difficult to achieve great graphics in a more modern big city settings. Lots of people and lighting and lots of everything everywhere compare to a much more rural 1900s RDR2 setting.  Tom Petty's song was pretty good to go along with Lucia and Jason being Bonnie and Clyde theme.  I wonder who is the voice actress for Lucia is.,Plot and Character,1.0
