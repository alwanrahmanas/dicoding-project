Wtf man this is crazy. NEW ERA,Trailer & Hype,1
Damn I wanted to watch it “live” and missed the notification but oh well. Atleast it’s here.,Trailer & Hype,0

Sick! Can't wait for the preorders!,Rilis Game,1
WHAT THE FUCK,Trailer & Hype,1
my god the radio silence following this will be suffering,Trailer & Hype,-1
GTA5 might be closer to 9/11 than GTA6 is to GTA5  Blows my fuckin’ mind. Its been so long…,Nostalgia,-1
graphics look amazing bar the character models they look off? like worse than RDR2. hyped asf tho,Visual Graphic,1
Hell yeah. I can't wait to be the best Florida Man and Woman I can be.,Plot and Character,1
The environment looks great but character models remind me of saints row. Not the same team as GTA V & Red dead and it shows,Visual Graphic,1
AYO I forget the dudes reddit name but he said it starts after with Lucia in prison he was right,Plot and Character,1
The trailer looks awesome! Every scene looks absolutely perfect!,Trailer & Hype,1

"Coming 2025…, what we gonna do until then?",Rilis Game,0
This game is going to be amazing. Looking forward to playing this one for 10 years as well….🤣🤙,Trailer & Hype,1
It’s real ladies and gentlemen. And I am in fucking awe.,Trailer & Hype,1
"2025 is a little bit of a bummer but at the same time, I'd rather them take their time developing the game and making it the best it could possibly be, rather then rushing it out.",Rilis Game,-1
Ngl it’s kinda lame that they had to release it early because of the leaks.   But this looks incredible! It’s been a long time coming and it’s time to get excited!,Rilis Game,-1
"Bad luck, I guess…",Trailer & Hype,-1
The cinematics looks cool but I'll wait for gameplay and player reviews 4-5 months after the honeymoon period ends. Starfield disappointment made it clear for me to avoid another hype train.,Visual Graphic,1
#trailerdayog   Holy shit this looks fantastic,Trailer & Hype,1
"A shame about the leaks. People have no patience I stg. I have to say though It’s pretty surreal to actually see this trailer. After years of leaks and rumors, it’s just insane and hard to believe.",Trailer & Hype,1
Didn't someone make a prediction on here not long ago about a man trying to pull an alligator out of a swimming pool?,Plot and Character,0
Currently uploading my reaction video onto YouTube. I'm still in a state of utter and complete shock.  To quote Jodie Foster from Contact: No - no words. No words to describe it. Poetry! They should have sent a poet. So beautiful. So beautiful...,Trailer & Hype,1
Graphics look really fucking good and the map looks huge,Visual Graphic,1

We’ve made it,Trailer & Hype,1
"I expected that we would have to wait quite a while for the game release, but over a year away still? Ugh. I know it’s going to be amazing, but I wish developers wouldn’t release trailers until the games are like 6 months out or less.",Rilis Game,-1
There was twerking twice in the trailer which tells me this will be the primary game mechanic.,Plot and Character,1
This looks so beautiful 😭😭😭,Visual Graphic,1
#Trailerdayog,Trailer & Hype,1
We made it people  Damn I want to cry right now,Trailer & Hype,1
![gif](giphy|dMn6DpYvzeKJ1UTar6|downsized)  The leakers house RN,Rilis Game,-1
i’m crying they said if u want the trailer so bad then take it,Rilis Game,-1
"The graphics and the city looks really good!  But I'm not excited AT ALL, this looks like the most zoomer thing that ever zoomed and I'm a zoomer, like ok cool I'll continue with my day I guess",Visual Graphic,1
"Graphic wise I get some cyberpunk vibes, anyway never seen facial and body animation like these, even in RDR2",Visual Graphic,1
Aka Florida Man Simulator,Plot and Character,1
logo was a bit fan-made ish,Visual Graphic,-1
I hope we can fill up our cars with gasoline. I want to choose what type of fuel to use as well. I can’t wait,Gameplay,1
"This doesn’t feel real rn, I have a lot of thoughts already on how vibrant this game looks. Seems liek it’s focused more in modern day technology with the social media interactions, the cars look awesome too. Everything about this trailer gets me hyped, just wish it wasn’t 2025 release date but hopefully it’s early 2025",Visual Graphic,1
The glocks are back,Gameplay,1
This looks incredible as expected. I Feel sorry for Rockstar though that they didn't get to put out the trailer when they wanted to. Fuck that leaker.,Trailer & Hype,1
"That was badass, but some of my friends immediately took a dislike to the graphics and the trailer as a whole.  This is why you shouldn't have set the bar so high for yourselves.  I loved it!!!  The cars look super cool and I'm super happy to see the tulip in rdr2 lighting.  I'm excited!",Trailer & Hype,1
"3/4s of those fan-made logos were actually on point, can't believe it",Visual Graphic,1
I'm so hard right now,Trailer & Hype,1
"im was crying watching it holy fuck its so good i cant believe it, i had it on the background and i was doing something when it was playing through my headphones so i checked what it was and FUCKING GTA 6 WAS PLAYING and i almost had a seizure",Trailer & Hype,1
The whole in game TikTok thing looks to have insane potential,Gameplay,1
The reason some of you feel it’s weird is cause GTA is breaking the uncanny valley. The character’s eyes appear to lock onto things like real people. This is insane.,Plot and Character,1
"Man, fucking 10 years and it looks like the wait has been worth it.  LET'S FUCKING GO",Trailer & Hype,1
I’m from Miami. This looks so accurate.,Visual Graphic,1

We can finally rest,Trailer & Hype,1
"If ""Florida Man"" was a video game. Let's go motherfuckers.",Trailer & Hype,1
"So one thing I caught, I think the state is called Leonida and not Florida. One of the social media parodies in the trailer makes reference to “Leonida Man” like the Florida Man meme.   Makes sense considering the political climate in the US right now, but I thought it was interesting since Florida is actually the state name in typical GTA canon.",Plot and Character,0
Fuck leakers,Rilis Game,-1
I’m happy that there’s representation for a woman mc but man… is prostitution just a non factor now? I’m not tryna get my back blown out,Plot and Character,0
"Damn, I was in elementary school when gta5 came out, and by the time gta6 comes out I'll have my bachelors degree.",Nostalgia,1

"It's a good thing this will release in 2025, just like RDR2 this will change the barriers of gaming and I personally cannot fucking wait for it.",Rilis Game,1
"Looks so dense. Full of cars, full of people. This game will be absolute chaos on a totally new level.",Gameplay,1
"Yeah, after seeing this I don’t think GTA online is ending anytime soon I’m not sure why people think it was going to end this year if we’re not going to get this game until 2025…",Rilis Game,0
Is this based on Florida,Plot and Character,0
The jiggle physics on that girl twerking are amazing,Plot and Character,1
"Is it just me or has Rockstar completely replaced Bryan Zampella's motion capture performance in the game?  Was he scamming us the whole time, or did R* get fed up with him promoting himself so outwardly for so long as part of the game without permission?",Plot and Character,0
I feel sooo bad for rockstar.  BUT THE GAME LOOKS SO GOOD BRO WTF,Rilis Game,-1
LETS GOOOOOOOOO ITS HISTORY SZN BOYS GET IN HERE,Trailer & Hype,1

"Looks awesome! Seems like the main 2 characters are in a relationship, which should add an interesting dynamic. First female protag too, which is cool. Looking forward to seeing more!",Plot and Character,1
"for a company that prides themselves on secrecy they really dropped the ball with this game icl. also anyone else not think after 10 years they could've been a bit more specific than ""2025""",Rilis Game,-1
#trailerdayOG That was insane! About to watch this about 1000 more times.,Trailer & Hype,1
"smash - smash - smash - smash - smash - pass on that granny - smash - that's it, thank you",Gameplay,1

"2025 release date... Not even a season given. We're in for a potential two year wait, maybe more... Oh damn.",Rilis Game,-1
So far Rockstar is closer to sucking my nuts unless they state that PC will get same release day as consoles,Rilis Game,-1

Holy shit Im going to Watch it Now For the first time,Trailer & Hype,1
I was here!,Trailer & Hype,1
mods after about an hour or two u should make another thread and call it like 'serious post trailer discussion' so after the hype dies down we can talk about it a bit more without so many spammy comments,Trailer & Hype,0
Is that the voice actor for mason?,Plot and Character,0
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,Trailer & Hype,1
2025 NOOOO,Rilis Game,-1

Got excited till I saw 2025 DAMN GOTTA WAIT LONGER. Atleast we have a year.,Rilis Game,-1
Praise Odin for these leaks,Rilis Game,1
"This is just my opinion but, this doesn't look like Rockstar... Cinematography feels odd, great graphics but no personality, no atmosphere, totally generic. Also, the logo is awful.",Visual Graphic,1
"Feel bad for Rockstar. I'm all for leaks, but leaking the trailer a day early with a shitty watermark for bitcoin is just trash. Even their reply to the leak is just saddening.",Rilis Game,-1
God it looks beautiful,Visual Graphic,1
Most realistic video game I've ever seen,Visual Graphic,1
and now the thing im most curious about is if they meet during the game? knew each other already? were together already?  and by the looks of it lucia is more central than jason,Plot and Character,0
"I seriously hope they somehow *intended* this or some of the leaks. Because if nothing was intended, RS is continually fucked over by this shit, imagine being a dev and working so hard on this *obvious* masterpiece only for someone to steal your thunder from under you. That's messed up.",Rilis Game,-1
I can't believe it. My expectations were so low. It looks so good.,Trailer & Hype,1

Did the trailer give anyone else saints row reboot vibes? Im worried,Trailer & Hype,-1

The city looks perfect. Has that dirty gritty feeling but ALOT of character. Man what a time.,Visual Graphic,1
Now I've just got to live till 2025. Bruh.,Rilis Game,-1
"Judging by the trailer it's clear Lucia is the ""main"" protagonist which I wasn't expecting.",Plot and Character,0
"76K views in 25 mins makes me a bit sad, i thought it’d be in the millions by now… lets not let rockstar down by watching it outside of their channel, for now out least",Trailer & Hype,-1
"I’m so delusional. I’m hoping that instead of a 2025 release date, it’ll be released next year (in a fashion I imagine is a calculated length of time based on from this trailer release schedule to its actual release converted into the 2025 game release schedule to a 2024 game release) and that they’re really just punking us because they know they can. A girl can dream though, right?   Also if anyone is really good at math, can possibly get a breakdown on a possible date for *funzies* please?",Rilis Game,1
Am I the only one who thinks that Jason looks a little bit like Arthur Morgan?,Plot and Character,0

Would love it if it dropped right around June 29th 2025 for my 40th birthday! I can't fucking wait!,Rilis Game,1
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE HERE , THIS IS IT , IT IS THIS, HOLY SHIT THIS GAME LOOKS FUCKING PHENOMENAL!!!! The city looks so damn alive, Jason and Lucia look AMAZING. 100x better than the leaks ( not that it wasn’t expected, but i was blown away by the difference) all those npc !!! Modern Vice City with Florida crazy shit ? YES . YES . YES. We need this shit NOWWWW😩 lol on a serious note I am more than willing to wait till 2025 for this, obviously didn’t show much from the story, but from what I can tell it seems to be trying to tell a bit more of a serious story !! Which idk about you guys was exactly what I was hoping for ! Dont get me wrong I want the classic GTA humor in there too, but I am legit not disappointed by 1 single thing I’ve seen in this trailer. I’ve already watched it 3 times and I’ll probably watch it 5 more times before the night is done 😂 holy shit. I know I keep saying that but like, holy shiiiiit. Also, it looked like Lucia was meeting up with a probation officer at the beginning of the trailer? That leak about her having a baby could possibly be true",Trailer & Hype,1
YOU CAN FUCKING DONK YOUR CAR!! So dope!,Gameplay,1

It's a shame someone had to leak it. Rockstar had no choice but to release it early on YouTube. Anyway I'm hyped!!!,Rilis Game,-1
I was here.,Trailer & Hype,1
"I made a post weeks ago and a lot of my predictions were stunningly accurate!  Happy post thanksgiving everyone! Just wanted to put out some of my predictions for what we may see  when the trailer finally drops in a few weeks. Some of these we won’t know for certain until the game finally drops or a few more detailed trailers come out.  1. First, It’ll be a rough cut original trailer like GTA IV “things will be different” and V “why did I move here”? which shows vice city and some interesting new content to chew on until we get new info.  2. Since the leak, I’d be willing to bet that R* is going to change the protagonist’s names as it was shown in addition to the style of dress, maybe even a complete overhaul, but I’m still thinking a female character will be one of the additions because it would be something different versus all the male protagonists that we’ve seen over the years.   3. Vehicles include a number of new boats like bass boats, small outboard boats, air boats, and large fishing boats, planes, helicopters, motorbikes, cars like pickup trucks, dune buggies, and bicycles.  4. Animals to be seen in game are alligators, pythons, wild boars, bears, cougars, pelicans, sharks, gamefish like marlin, sailfish, and grouper, dogs, cats, etc.   5. Fresh and saltwater fishing will be one of the new activities in addition to graffiti tagging.  6. Perhaps a call back or two to GTA IV, V, and of course OG vice city.  7. I would be blown away if the physics returned to a GTA IV level, but am thinking it will remain at the V standard.  8. More definitive weather events like hurricanes, tornados affecting more rural areas of the map, in addition to seeing how the ocean tides effect various areas around the map.  9. Unconventional weapons like spearguns, blunt force trauma items like rocks, bricks, cinderblocks, and melee weapons like pepper spray, tasers, and bean bag shotguns. Riot shields make an appearance at the amount of riots or protests that will play a role in the game. Classic GTA weapons like a MG249 and colt python like from vice city make a return.  10. Vehicle damage will be similar to GTA IV.  11. I’m hoping that the story will be akin to GTA IV which revolves around the American dream and revenge whilst incorporating aspects of GTA V heists.  12. Aspects of 2020’s American and world culture like social justice, transgender or no gender people, Israel/Palestinian conflict politics, and a TikTok parody like life invader.   a reference to the COVID 19 pandemic in which people may wear masks in public or be fearful of germs. Because trump resides in Florida, perhaps there will be a presidential person who has a great amount of secret service presence near them but that’s probably a stretch.    Just some of my early thoughts regarding the upcoming release of the trailer and ultimately the game itself. As for a release date, I would think it’s coming in the year 2025 and no later.  Please contribute your thoughts, hopes, and wishes for the latest installment of the greatest open world crime game ever conceived.  Thank you kindly!",Plot and Character,0

I think that the trailer literally broke a new record for a YT video to hit million likes. It literally hit 1.6million on 22minutes   I Googled and found that the old record was in one hour held by some Indian movie trailer,Trailer & Hype,1
Anyone seen that “Pimp my ride” place?? Cars custom is going to be insane.!!!!,Gameplay,1

Extremely fucked up of the leaker to take away this moment for rockstar. Couldn’t just wait another 15 hours???   Been working hard and for a decade on this game and they were forced to drop the trailer early. I hope the leaker gets sued,Rilis Game,-1

"Looks sick. Hopefully the rural parts of the game are kinda like RDR2 and you can explore, hunt, fish, etc and do backcountry type stuff in a detailed environment, and not an after thought. Hoping more buildings and homes are enterable in some way. Cyberpunk felt like it missed a lot because the vast majority of the city was inaccessible. I imagine Rockstar has the technology to make decent-enough indoor environments at scale, and then they can slowly add more detailed interiors as time passes.",Gameplay,1
"This is fucking crazy, I was here.",Trailer & Hype,1
I WAS FUCKING HERE  HISTORY  #trailerdayog,Trailer & Hype,1
Cries in 2025,Rilis Game,-1
All I gotta say is.......   **DAAAAAAYUUUUM LUCIA!**  That hourglass shape they gave her haha.  😳  I would say they have topped RDR2 graphics and they will have around 2 more years to polish it further.  You all have to remember it is much more difficult to achieve great graphics in a more modern big city settings. Lots of people and lighting and lots of everything everywhere compare to a much more rural 1900s RDR2 setting.  Tom Petty's song was pretty good to go along with Lucia and Jason being Bonnie and Clyde theme.  I wonder who is the voice actress for Lucia is.,Plot and Character,1
YOOOOO WE DID IT,Trailer & Hype,1

I think parts of it look funny because all of it is in game footage. I don’t think rockstar tries to make cutscenes look better other than some mouthing animations. This is literally RDR2 graphics in GTA but a slight upgrade. Idk how they could have done better than that.,Visual Graphic,0

I’ve lived in Tampa Bay for over 10 years and work a ton in Miami. I must say this is the MOST FLORIDA FUCKING THING I’VE EVER SEEN!!! LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOO,Trailer & Hype,1

"Great another female main role that nobody asked or cared for. Hasn’t Rockstar learned from Disney? There are no more Sarah Connor or Ripley’s in today’s world.  However, the graphics look great and how they’re incorporated social media and added a SickTok in the game as well. Will be very interesting to see if you can upload in game footage of random shit in GTA own SickTock ecosystem. That would be a next Gen defining moment in UX gameplay",Plot and Character,-1
This genuinely made me happy when i watched it. Haven’t felt that in some time,Trailer & Hype,1
"This is the biggest thing in all of entertainment. Not just gaming. This will literally, and I am not exaggerating here, change the world. The bar is now so high that only Rockstar themselves can reach it. What a trailer.",Trailer & Hype,1

"Seeing this trailer pretty much cements why I don't like GTA games. They're more or less based on reality. When I play games, I want to go to a place or experience something that isn't real. I see enough of the real world just by living in it and games for me are to escape.  I do hope whoever plays this enjoys it. It's not for me but for those it IS for, I hope they have fun.",Gameplay,-1

"Man, they fucking *NAILED* the song choice in this trailer : “Love Is A Long Road” by Tom Petty.   - Relatively deep cut by a popular artist as is custom in GTA trailers (Petty is also a Gainesville, FL native, which makes it even better)   - Written in the 1980s with both synth and classic rock influence to match both the “Miami Vice” aesthetic as well as  the chaos of GTA and the more rural parts of Florida.   - Song lyrics talking about a chaotic and tumultuous romance and connecting it with driving cars….In a GTA game with two characters with Bonnie-and-Clyde  dynamic.   - relatively up-tempo to keep pace with both action scenes  but also well fitting just as ambient background sound.   Well done, Rockstar editing team. Well done.",Trailer & Hype,1

So fucking excited to play it!,Trailer & Hype,1
"Am I the only one that isn't really that hyped about it?  It looks better than GTA V for sure, but not ten years better.  The fat chick twerking animation gets reused in the club and a bit later she's on the roof of a car doing the same thing.  The NPC's still look like stiff plastic avatars.  The main characters, not really feeling them, nor am I feeling that typical GTA lunacy/odd vibe, just cliché gangsta brother and sister vibes.",Visual Graphic,-1
2025? Smh,Rilis Game,-1
This did NOT get me hype. Was expecting so much more. Big let down.   Graphics look cool but animations are whack. Nothing had WOW factor to me. Years of waiting and I think I genuinely have less hype after the trailer.,Trailer & Hype,-1
SEE YALL IN 2 YEARS!,Rilis Game,1

"I'm kinda mad that the leak forced their hand because the trailer dropping tomorrow morning gave me something to look forward to when I got home from in the morning (it would have dropped 6am my time, which is my last hour of shift) before going to bed.  All that said, this may be the first GTA game that I actually want to play as it's intended, meaning doing the full story and not just driving around the city and occasionally getting into fights or running over pedestrians and then subsequently running from police.",Rilis Game,-1

"Jesus, rockstar what in the f\*\*\* how are they able to do this? Probably a lot of artificial intelligence I'd imagine? Or maybe there's been a lot of optimisation and improvements in graphics programming over the years? Probably both? If it turns out this good at launch it would be crazy, especially on current hardware like ps5 or current xbox",Visual Graphic,1

"There's so much to dissect. The world looks incredibly organic. Rockstar really nailed the atmosphere and environment in RDR2, most notably the NPC AI.   I have high hopes they are going to be pushing the boundaries in sandbox immersion again, and I can't wait.   You know its going to put all the other games released in the last few years to shame.

#trailerdayog I’m glad I don’t have to wait til I’m 40 for this. Here’s for another decade of GTA!,Trailer & Hype,1
The trailer looked sick.  But I can't lie I'm a little disappointed about the trailer being leaked and rockstar having to release it early. I miss the days where there was genuine hype and build up leading to things like this. Leakers ruin the hype for everything.  Rockstar already had that gameplay leaked and now they had this trailer leaked. It has to suck for the employees who were so excited about this.,Trailer & Hype,1

Edit: Finishing It hasn't set In yet, so many details. Models were real eye candy, I had a feeling that It wouldn't be any time relatively soon we'd get It, not another two years (or year In a half) as most suspected.   I still didn't catch much Info on Lucia and Jason, other than they're both cons, lovers, and they're back. I assume they're going to do a ""big score"" type deal and take on the criminal underworld AND The Civilian Overworld. No one's safe type deal.",Trailer & Hype,1
"This will probably be buried below but here I go. I was around 12 or 13 when gta 5 came out and now i am 22! I remember the GameStop guy knew my mom and I cause I went there so much and when my mom went to buy the game he told my mother there were hookers in the game so she did not buy it lol! I was so mad at my mom and that game stop guy, eventually i got the game but now I will have lived long enough to buy the new gta. I went through hardcore drug addiction and alcoholism, I lost family and friends, I went through jobs to homelessness many times and I am now over a year sober, I have a job I love and just moved into my first house with two friends of mine! All this happened from gta 5 to gta 6 trailer being released. I am truly blessed and grateful to see this day come before my eyes thank you Rockstar just thank you.",Nostalgia,1

"It looks like that 4 door Sabre that's making the hard left is the 1984 Polaris V8 from GTA Vice City Stories which would be a sweet reference to that game. Also, that pink car pulling into the a body shop looks like the 1992 Tacoma from San Andreas which was based of the 1980s Chevy box Caprice used as police cars in LA. So I'm stoked for that",Nostalgia,1

How do I get that tag,Trailer & Hype,1
Daaaaaamnnnnn #trailerdayog,Trailer & Hype,1
"the amount of ratchetness in this short trailer made me uncomfortable and proud at the same damn time. Rockstar recon is unmatched when it comes to sociology. they don't give a damn about offensiveness or pollical correctness. they better not shy away from Leonidas(Florida) overt anti-black racism. even the Latina having a white boyfriend is on brand. Getting the tv shows ""Claws"", ""P-Valley"" and ""CSI-Miami"" vibe from this. even the ""Bad Boys"" Movie franchise seems to be an inspiration. Damn 2025. i'll be 40, pray for me. hope to be here to play this.",Plot and Character,1

I have such high expectations for this game it isn't even funny,Trailer & Hype,1
"You now what, FAHK Rockstar and kudos to the leaker. We still have over a year probably a year and a half before this even launches. This Xmas is ruined cause all I am going to want is GTA 6 and now all we have for the next few months is this trailer to sit and think about all the alligator modes, that sweet mud party, all the 360’s in the middle of the intersection’s and all the “Florida Man” characters running around being all Florida Man.",Rilis Game,-1
"For the people who want the real places shown:   1s - Turnpike. Doral? Probably towards the pen there where Noriega is  5s - South Beach/Edgewater  21s - Everglades, Airboats  22s- Collins  24s - PortMiami  25s - Shula at the part where you turn to Wynwood/Stadium wtf  28s - THATS FUCKING WYNWOOD but also reminds me across 95 that street in Allapatah  29s - KoD  30s - Coral Gables. Near Vizcaya  32s - Tuttle  33s - Ocean Drive  34s - Generic club. Space maybe or E11Ven  36s - The KEYS!?  38s - Brickell  40s - That's way out there in Hialeah considering distance  Some establishing onlymiami shots. ngl that pool with the shark is straight up kendall and that last one is the beach still  46s - Overtown, Lyric Theatre  48s - reminds me of the publix lil cafeteria thing they have  49s - Elian!?? but lol a sunco  50s - even the turnpike stuff. that looks like riverside  54s - very kendall  55s - either they added the muck or thats homestead  58s - HAMLET. Oh my GOD. Homestead is called Hamlet isnt it lol. Or it's the Villages spoof. But the classic low income housing blocks.  1m - edgewaterish. It's near where Messi lives  The Spanish is a lil weird. But tattoo references. Leonida. Trying to think of what that would be. Not really much Greco-Roman referencing in town. Unless Leonida is a sub name for their version of Cuba or El Salvador. Otherwise maybe Coral Gables?  1:06 - Skittle houses. Overtown  1:07 - 10th ave?  is that Robert Rubenstein?  1:11 - i wanna say near miccosukeee  1:18 - they hit up big daddys!! (the flannigans liquor store)",Gameplay,1
Yup,Trailer & Hype,1
That looked kinda bad.   All the people looked so ‘uncanny valley’. Like none of them moved right. Everything was exaggerated.   It also looks like GTA V with more neon.,Visual Graphic,-1

"I just can't get over the graphics, the way the hair moves and how beautiful the colors of this game look. As a kid who grew up in the 2000s and has been playing GTA since Vice City! Seeing that they've come back full circle and bigger and better makes my little   gamer heart do flips.",Visual Graphic,1

"Looks a little weird, but otherwise lively and similar to V. Not sure if I'm going to be the biggest fan of the 1:1 recreation of Floridian culture lol",Visual Graphic,0
Idk fam this just visually looks like a Far Cry game. I like GTA V because it still feels like a video game. Everyone these days has to go for this hyper realistic look and they all just end up feeling exactly the same.,Visual Graphic,-1
Breaking news: Florida man forced do stupid shit  around the city by crazy ass latina,Plot and Character,1

Looks just like Florida lol,Visual Graphic,1
"This looks incredible, just the sheer density of everything is at a scale I've never seen in a game like this  I'm suspecting a very heavy social media-based satirical slant to this one, based on all the TikTok-lookin' shots in the trailer",Visual Graphic,1
Yayayaya,Trailer & Hype,1

"I had to play it on the living room TV.   Holy shit! Holy fucking shit! We're going to Florida, friends!",Trailer & Hype,1
Why does the dude look different or is it different hairstyles and cloths,Plot and Character,0
"It goes without saying, but the random encounters are gonna slap so hard. There's so many crazy, interesting looking characters I can't wait to run into. Obviously in general it looks drop dead gorgeous from the night life to the day time. Really hoping there's a lot of cool places to explore and find stuff.",Gameplay,1
I didn’t believe it when I first saw it on YouTube. I was wondering how they got their name to look just like Rockstar Games. It also says that it is a song.,Trailer & Hype,1
"I mean. It looks like GTA V but Florida, ig.  Maybe I’ve just kinda outgrown GTA. Back when I was in middle school there was nothing else like it, but honestly this game is gonna have to do some really cool shit for me to really care this time around",Visual Graphic,0

"A few years from now, they're going to find the leaker at the bottom of the ocean, wearing a nice pair of cement shoes.  Seriously, though... the game looks real, holy shit.  The camera footage, in particular, looks it was actually filmed, not rendered in the game engine.  I can't WAIT for 2025!  (Or probably 2026, for the PC version.)",Rilis Game,1

It’s dumb the main character is a female,Plot and Character,-1
"The first thing that struck me was how densely populated the environment is. Lots of people, lots of cars. Lots of activity. I have my doubt still that this is how it will be on release, but if it is... Wow.",Gameplay,1
"So question, they release the trailer early, because of a leak right? So what's going to happen to the leaker? Are they going to get sued to hell and back.",Rilis Game,-1

To think this’ll be my first GTA game ever. I’m so glad I was born and the circumstances of my life that’s led me to today typing this in a car heading home.

"this is a moment in history. we made it lads. feels surreal even seeing ‘grand theft auto vi’.   can’t lie i was expecting much more from the trailer. maybe i’m tripping but to me it just looks like gta 5 😭😂, like the shots on the beach. but that’s what happens when you get used to seeing the same game for 10 whole years. this trailer didn’t really do much for me, didn’t feel like they even showed that much of the actual game   obvs it’s just a little trailer but i was expecting it to be groundbreaking for the first trailer when you have to wait 10 years for it. regardless tho i’m still hyped, i know the actual gameplay is probably going to be incredible, and the game will be a masterpiece, just saying from the first trailer it doesn’t look much different.   2025 is crazy 😭 but idk why people are too surprised, i knew it would come then. let’s hope for everyone’s sake it’s the early months of the year but i think we all know it’ll be like sep-dec 😩.  edit: one thing i want to add is ik it’s a bit early to be saying this but i hope this game has a more normal length cycle and isn’t another decade+ one. there’s just absolutely no need, like 5 years would be fine. but i know i’m absolutely dreaming and i highly doubt that, especially since rockstar will likely be focusing on their other game franchises, like didn’t they say there was another rdr coming.",Trailer & Hype,-1

Compare FSX (Flight Simulator 10) that released in 2006 to its successor ""Flight Simulator"" AKA FS2020 that released in, you guessed it, 2020. WORLD of difference between those 2.        Meanwhile GTA 6 looks like GTA 5 with new characters and I guess a bigger map? There's absolutely nothing about this that made me go ""whoa, that was worth 12 years."" I mean it's whatever. I don't get the hype for it from fans that act like this is going to be life-changing. It's going to be a new GTA, and that's it. Nothing paradigm shifting. It drops when it drops, and ya, I'll play like everyone else. I don't think Rockstar really cares that much about reception. It's GTA and they know everyone is going to buy it and play it regardless. It's just nothing like going from GTA 3 to GTA 4 though, that's for sure, and that was only 7 years. This is 12 years, and there's nothing next-gen here.",Visual Graphic,-1

"This trailer was beyond pathetic. All the creative minds already left long before this game started production. The geniuses who created the franchise that we grew up on are long gone. That era of creativity/epicness ended in 2012ish where those guys just added their 90s/2000s humour into the game and left. Even though Gta 5 came out in 2013, it was built throughout 2011ish in an era that was still serious/creative. The trailer for that game was normal built on 2000s culture and that was Gta 5 which was at the end of an era anyways. Compare that to Gta SA or even Gta 4, the themes in those older games were much more serious/darker and grittier.   I can just imagine the development team. Bunch of awkward ugly outcast weirdos trying to live vicariously through a videogame with all these freakshow characters they've made in the game. No persona or creativity. Who even cares about this awkward shit? Compare that to Nfs Mw or Saints Row, different worlds I swear. The tone of Gta 4 was so heavy/deep and dark/gritty just like the other games from before 2009ish. We had Saints Row with juiced up gangsta thugs running around with 8ft dildos, Cod with Nazi Zombies and brutal war crimes, Nfs Mw with neon Ricers/Thrash Metal with naked stripper babes doing the commentary/VT, you had the guys in Jackass as advertising for advertising of Tony Hawk Skate and stuff. It was epic and nuts. I watched 2000s footage of videogame development, mannn, the way the guys were acting. It was like a stag night/college frat party lol. People talking all loud and talking shit like jackasses/throwing bottles and shoving eachother haha, they all looked like normal guys, what happened I swear. This kind of behaviour translated into the videogames we got from 1999-2009.   Fast forward to now and we got this weird nonsense. Honestly when you compare to what we used to get from the 90s-2011, then only you'll realise. Most people won't get it despite the trailer being the way it is. I mean what even was that weird nonsense. Didn't expect it to be so damn weird and nothing like what I wanted in a videogame. Wildly inappropriate and not even in a good way, just, weird. Very disappointed as games seem to follow in with this same camp theme.",Trailer & Hype,-1
#trailerdayog btw this is stupid and has a gross and net realistic value of 0. 0 anything. Who cares that we all witnessed a video game’s trailer the day of it’s (early) release?

Which is weird because I'm in north eastern Australia, and yet I've seen or hear ALL of that happening here in real life.",Nostalgia,1
